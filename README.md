## Plan on improving:

1.  🌓 Add a light and dark theme for users toggle.
2.  💬 Add a comment button next to the like button for users to comment.
3.  🔐 Demo Login System: Create a new login.html page with username + password form. Create a Demo User credentials (e.g., demoUser / 1234). On success → Logs you into Demo Profile.
